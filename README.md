# LeetCode Solutions

This is a repo of my LeetCode solutions. It is set to automatically sync with the LeetCode.com web application at 10:45 PM every day.

## Automations
This repo uses the LeetCode Sync action from [@joshcai](https://github.com/joshcai), available on the GitHub Marketplace [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/leetcode-sync).

More information on this workflow, and how to set one up for yourself, can be found in the original repo's README.md file, located [here](https://github.com/joshcai/leetcode-sync/blob/master/README.md).
